# Does Environmental Disclosure Matter?  
*Evidence from Textual Analysis of 10-K Filings*

## Overview

This project studies whether environmental language in 10-K filings helps explain U.S. stock returns beyond standard risk factors. Using ClimateBERT models, we construct:  
- **ENV Score**: share of environmental content  
- **ENV Sentiment**: tone of environmental language  

We apply these variables to Fama-French three- and five-factor models across 70 S&P 500 firms from 2018â€“2023.

### Ohaness Alokpa
My contribution focused on performing the Fama-French three- and five-factor regressions, first using only standard factors and then incorporating firm-specific environmental measures (ENV Score and ENV Sentiment) to evaluate the impact of environmental disclosure on the cross-section of U.S. stock returns. Additionally, I provided the trend analysis of ENV Score and ENV Sentiment over time. This work is contained in the FF3 FF5 folder.
